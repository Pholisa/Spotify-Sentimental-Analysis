The chosen data set is a Spotify Review Dataset, it consists of the following columns: 
“Time_submitted”, “Review”, “Rating”, “Total_thumbsup”, and “Reply”. All the columns add up 
to a total of 5 columns with 61594 rows. 

The “Review” and “Ratings” columns are the columns that will be used in the analysis. 
The “Review” column consists of reviews that were written by people. The “Rating” column 
consists of a scale of 1-5. In this case, 5 will be the best and 1 will be the least.

Reasons why the chosen data set is appropriate: 
The dataset does not consist of images, it consists of texts, and sentences that have been 
written by critics. Reviews are mostly filled with text content, which enables one to perform text 
processing. The “Review” column consists of textual content, these reviews are a 
representation of people's experience with Spotify. These allow us to either identify the review 
as a negative or a positive review, based on what has been written. The “Rating” column 
consists of numbers that are stored as ‘string’. 

Text Processing can be performed, through text processing techniques such as Punctuation 
Removal, Stop Words, Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization. These all perform different 
functionalities to ensure that the text is in the right state to be used for classification. These 
techniques help in achieving the best results. 

Sentimental Analysis can be performed from the Spotify Review data set, these reviews 
represent negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, in this dataset the column “Rating” 
represents the sentiments. Having sentiments enables us to achieve the goal of determining the 
feelings of individuals. Conducting Sentimental Analysis enables a better understanding of the 
reception of the music. 

Topic Modelling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are utilized to identify the 
different themes that are commonly used. The LDA technique helps discover trends and 
patterns that cannot be easily discovered. 

Features can be extracted during text processing. And finally, the data can be split into a training 
set and a testing set, once the data has been split it can be fit into the algorithm for training. 
This data set is also appropriate for the analysis because it can help Spotify to correct its 
mistakes identify where they are going wrong and find solutions. Identify patterns that are hard 
to discover, this will help the organization understand where improvements can be made and 
help plan for the future. It is essential for Spotify, to further be successful.
